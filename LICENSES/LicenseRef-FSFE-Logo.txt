# Terms of usage

You may use the FSFE logo as part of the logo of your local FSFE group or FSFE
team and to promote activities your group or team organizes. For example, if
your local FSFE group runs a booth, you may use the logo.

Furthermore, at events not organized by the FSFE directly or a local FSFE group,
speakers representing the FSFE may use the logo to clearly show the affiliation
of the speaker. That does not mean you can use the logo in a way that makes it
seem as if the FSFE is endorsing the event.

Generally, the logo of the FSFE must never be used in a way that could be
understood as endorsing certain activities, home pages, products or entities not
organized by an FSFE team or local group, unless you get prior consent from the
FSFE. If in doubt, please contact <contact@fsfe.org> if you wish to know whether
your intended usage is suitable and whether you can use it in a certain context.
