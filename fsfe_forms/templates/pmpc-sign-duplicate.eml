Subject: Public Code: Duplicated signature

Dear {{ name }},

We have noticed that you already signed the open letter “Public Money, 
Public Code”, calling for legislation that supports Free Software in 
the public sector, with your email address.

To ensure that each signature is unique, we cannot count double 
signatures. But you can still help! Make your friends and colleagues 
aware of this initiative and convince them of signing the open letter 
just like you did.

With your help we can achieve our goal of making all publicly financed 
software to be released as Free Software!

Visit www.publiccode.eu for more information on this campaign


Thank you for your support,
Matthias Kirschner, President FSFE
