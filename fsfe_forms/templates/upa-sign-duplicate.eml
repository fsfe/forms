Subject: Public Code: Duplicated signature

Dear {{ name }},

We have noticed that you already signed the Open Letter about the universal
right to install any software on any device, with your email address.

To ensure that each signature is unique, we cannot count double
signatures. But you can still help! Make your friends and colleagues
aware of this initiative and convince them of signing the open letter
just like you did.

With your help we can achieve our goal of installing software on any
device!

Visit upcyclingandroid.org for more information on this campaign


Thank you for your support,
Matthias Kirschner, President FSFE
